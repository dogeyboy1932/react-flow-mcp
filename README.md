How To Use:

Run the below commands
```
bun install
bun dev
```

create a .env file and paste in this:
```
VITE_GOOGLE_API_KEY="your api key"
```



Next Steps:
1. could you create your own mcp server from the UI itself? (Code would need to be copied and pasted?)
I feel this functionality has been issued by no-code platforms like n8n...need to find a novelty in this

2. Pre-built tools...open source this and make it modular

3. Make chat a context...

4. Get users from database and not local file

* MCP Servers must be client compatible (cant use node/promises). At least it doesn't work in this tab transport.
